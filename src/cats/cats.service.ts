/*
  Provider

  Providers are a fundamental concept in Nest. 
  Many of the basic Nest classes may be treated as a provider â€“ 
  services, repositories, factories, helpers, and so on. 

  The main idea of a provider is that it can be injected as a dependency
  this means objects can create various relationships with each other,
   
  and the function of "wiring up" instances of objects can largely be delegated 
  to the Nest runtime system.
