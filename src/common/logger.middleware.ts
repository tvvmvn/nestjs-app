/* 
Middleware is a function which is called before the route handler. 

Middleware functions have access to the request and response objects, 
and the next() middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. 
The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
- execute any code.
- make changes to the request and the response objects.
- end the request-response cycle.
- call the next middleware function in the stack.
- if the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, 
it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. 
Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.
